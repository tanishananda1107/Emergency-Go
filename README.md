# 🚑 EmergencyGo

EmergencyGo is a smart emergency response platform designed to provide quick access to critical services such as ambulance dispatch, doctor-on-demand, and fire emergency assistance. The platform focuses on reducing response time by combining an intuitive web interface with real-time tracking and a scalable backend system.

What started as a concept for faster emergency access evolved into a full-stack project that combines modern UI design, real-time communication, and API-driven architecture. From building animated interfaces to implementing live tracking simulations, this project represents a hands-on learning journey in developing practical, impactful technology.

EmergencyGo integrates web development, API design using FastAPI, real-time updates with WebSockets, and interactive mapping for tracking emergency units. While the current version is a working prototype, the system is designed to be extended with IoT devices, GPS integration, and smart-city infrastructure in future iterations.
